 **Description**
 \description
{


Creates printable herbarium labels from field book data stored in a CSV-formatted file.

This function is optimized for records from the USA by generating geographic maps

at the county level. For records from other countries, only the country-level map

is included. If geographic coordinates are available, specimen points are plotted

on the maps. The function also retrieves taxon authorities and performs automatic

nomenclatural updates using the

\code

}

package.

} 

 **Details**
 \details
{


The function performs extensive pre-processing including trimming extra spaces,

fixing punctuation, removing artifacts, and inserting default values for missing

taxon/specimen info. Scientific names are cross-referenced against the

\code
{
lcvplants
}
 database to update taxonomy and retrieve the correct author citation.

Locality and habitat descriptions are automatically formatted for line breaks.

Labels are arranged in grids of six per page and exported as paginated PDF files.
