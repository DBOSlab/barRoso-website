## Overview

When working with plant specimen data from multiple biodiversity repositories (e.g., GBIF, JABOT, speciesLink), users often encounter overlapping records across sources. `barroso` offers the `combine_herbaria()` function to merge, harmonize, and optionally deduplicate these datasets based on collection codes.

This article demonstrates how to:

- Merge multiple data sources into a unified data frame
- Identify and remove overlapping records
- Prioritize a preferred source when conflicts occur


## Function: `barroso_cat()`

```r
combined_df <- barroso_cat(
  list_sources = list(
    GBIF = gbif_data,
    speciesLink = splink_data,
    JABOT = jabot_data
  ),
  keep_source = "GBIF"
)
```

## Arguments

- `list_sources`: A named list of data frames. Each represents a biodiversity source.
- `keep_source`: Optionally specify a preferred source (e.g., "GBIF"). When overlaps are detected via `collectionCode`, records from the preferred source are retained.

If no source is specified, the function merges all sources, retaining potential duplicates for further reconciliation.


## Example

```r
library(barroso)

# Load three herbarium datasets
jabot <- read.csv("jabot.csv")
gbif <- read.csv("gbif.csv")
splink <- read.csv("splink.csv")

# Merge, giving preference to GBIF for overlapping herbaria
combined_df <- barroso_cat(
  list_sources = list(
    GBIF = gbif,
    speciesLink = splink,
    JABOT = jabot
  ),
  keep_source = "GBIF"
)
```

## How It Works

- `collectionCode` is used to detect overlapping herbaria
- Only one record is retained when `keep_source` is defined
- All datasets are aligned to a common column structure
- Missing fields are filled with `NA` for consistency

This harmonization step is especially useful before running downstream standardization (`barroso_std()`) or duplicate detection (`barroso_flag_duplicates()`).

## Tips

- Ensure each dataset includes a `collectionCode` column
- Use `keep_source = NULL` if you want to preserve all records
- Use `barroso_std()` after combining to clean remaining fields
