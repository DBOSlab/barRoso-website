## Overview

`barRoso` (Biodiversity Analysis and Record Reconciliation for Organizing Specimen Observations) is an R package that streamlines biodiversity data cleaning, integration, and reconciliation, particularly for herbarium records. The toolkit supports workflows from data curation to label production, helping botanists, curators, and researchers analyze plant specimen collections more efficiently.

Named in honor of [Graziela Maciel Barroso](https://www.gov.br/jbrj/pt-br/assuntos/colecoes/arquivistica/graziela-maciel-barroso), one of Brazil's most respected botanists, the name **barRoso** also nods to its native programming environmentâ€”**R**.

The package was originally developed for the [JABOT Virtual Herbarium](https://jabot.jbrj.gov.br), maintained by the [Rio de Janeiro Botanical Garden](https://www.gov.br/jbrj), but it is generalizable to other biodiversity repositories such as [GBIF](https://www.gbif.org), [SEINet](https://swbiodiversity.org/seinet), [REFLORA](https://floradobrasil.jbrj.gov.br/reflora), and [speciesLink](https://specieslink.net).
The package was originally developed to support the cleaning and reconciliation of plant specimen records retrieved from the [Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF)](https://www.gbif.org), but its flexible design makes it broadly applicable to other biodiversity data sources. These include national and institutional repositories such as the [JABOT Virtual Herbarium](https://jabot.jbrj.gov.br), maintained by the [Rio de Janeiro Botanical Garden](https://www.gov.br/jbrj) and [REFLORA](https://floradobrasil.jbrj.gov.br/reflora), as well as [SEINet](https://swbiodiversity.org/seinet) and [speciesLink](https://specieslink.net).
