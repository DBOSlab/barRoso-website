### What is the barRoso?

`barRoso` is an R package for cleaning, standardizing, and reconciling plant specimen records—especially from biodiversity repositories like [GBIF](https://www.gbif.org). It streamlines workflows for curators, researchers, and data scientists by automating the harmonization of taxonomic, geographic, and collector metadata. Optimized for reproducibility, `barRoso` facilitates the detection of duplicate specimens and improves data quality across herbarium datasets.

### What can I use barRoso for?

- Standardize collector names and associated collector numbers — a crucial step for detecting duplicate specimens across herbaria
- Harmonize taxonomic and geographic fields (e.g., family, genus, locality, country)
- Detect and flag potential duplicate records using cleaned metadata
- Generate herbarium labels from field notebooks, including taxon authority and geolocation maps
- Prepare high-quality datasets for biodiversity, floristic, and taxonomic studies

### How do I install barRoso?

Follow the [Get Started guide](/get-started/index.qmd) for full instructions on installing the package and its dependencies via GitHub.

### Is barRoso free to use?

Yes. `barRoso` is open-source software licensed under the [MIT License](https://opensource.org/license/mit/), which permits unrestricted use, modification, and distribution.

### What output can barRoso generate?

While `barRoso` does not directly produce formatted reports, it supports:

- Cleaned and standardized data frames for downstream biodiversity analysis
- Visual maps in herbarium label generation
- Easy integration with RMarkdown, Quarto, and Shiny for reporting and dashboards

### How does barRoso work?

Unlike many packages that rely on static dictionaries to clean collector names, `barRoso` uses a robust set of regular expressions (regex) to dynamically identify and standardize collector patterns across datasets. This approach allows `barRoso` to generalize better across sources and spelling variations — even when names are inconsistently formatted. Combined with harmonization of geographic and taxonomic fields, this makes the package especially powerful for detecting duplicates and preparing data for downstream analysis.

### Why doesn’t `barRoso` remove incomplete or inconsistent records?

Because **standardization** is more powerful than deletion. Many biodiversity records contain valuable metadata even when some fields are missing or messy. `barRoso` standardizes and flags potential problems but leaves the final decision to the user—preserving data integrity and maximizing research potential.


### Who are the developers of barRoso?

Development is sponsored by [JBRJ](https://www.gov.br/jbrj/pt-br), [FINEP](http://www.finep.gov.br), and [CNPq](https://www.gov.br/cnpq/pt-br). Main developer:

- Domingos Cardoso ([\@DBOSlab](https://github.com/DBOSlab))

### Why the name barRoso?

The name honors Graziela Maciel Barroso (1912–2003), a pioneering Brazilian botanist. It also serves as an acronym: **B**iodiversity **A**nalysis and **R**ecord **R**econciliation for **O**rganizing **S**pecimen **O**bservations, highlighting both its mission and its deep roots in the R programming ecosystem.
